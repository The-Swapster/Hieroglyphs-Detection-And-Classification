# Hieroglyphs-Detection-And-Classification

**Aim:** Detecting and Classifying Hieroglyphs using CNN and Logistic Regression
**Steps**
* Phase 1
  * Reading dataset and performing label encoding on the labels
  * Splitting the dataset into training and testing
  * Using Inception V3 for extraing features
  * Using these features to train and test using Logistic Regression
  * Evaluating the model using accuracy
  * Testing model on unseen data
  
* Phase 2
  * Read the dataset
  * Augment the dataset
  * Label encoding the labels
  * Perform one hot encoding on the labels
  * Split into training and testing dataset
  * Develop CNN model
  * Evaluate on
    * Loss
    * Accuracy
    * Precision
    * Recall
    * F1 Score
  * Model is generalised on another dataset

**Conclusion**
* CNN is better performing
* Model is generalised
